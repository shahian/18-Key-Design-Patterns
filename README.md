# 18-Key-Design-Patterns
Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems, resulting in a smoother, more efficient development process. They serve as blueprints for building better software structures. 
 ## These are some of the most popular patterns:
1. [Abstract Factory: Family Creator - Makes groups of related items.](#abstractFactory)
2. [Builder: Lego Master - Builds objects step by step, keeping creation and appearance](#builder)
3. [Prototype: Clone Maker - Creates copies of fully prepared examples.](#prototype)
4. [Singleton: One and Only - A special class with just one instance.](#singleton)
5. [Adapter: Universal Plug - Connects things with different interfaces.](#adapter)
6. [Bridge: Function Connector - Links how an object works to what it does.](#bridge)
7. [Composite: Tree Builder - Forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts.](#composite)
8. [Decorator: Customizer - Adds features to objects without changing their core.](#decorator)
9. [Facade: One-Stop-Shop - Represents a whole system with a single, simplified interface.](#facade)
10. [Flyweight: Space Saver - Shares small, reusable items efficiently.](#flyweight)
11. [Proxy: Stand-In Actor - Represents another object, controlling access or actions.](#proxy)
12. [Chain of Responsibility: Request Relay - Passes a request through a chain of objects until handled.](#chain)
13. [Command: Task Wrapper - Turns a request into an object, ready for action.](#command)
14. [Iterator: Collection Explorer - Accesses elements in a collection one by one.](#iterator)
15. [Mediator: Communication Hub - Simplifies interactions between different classes.](#mediator)
16. [Memento: Time Capsule - Captures and restores an object's state.](#memento)
17. [Observer: News Broadcaster - Notifies classes about changes in other objects.](#observer)
18. [Visitor: Skillful Guest - Adds new operations to a class without altering it](#visitor)
